\initial {T}his submission is the result of our work at Thinline, conducted as part of our graduation project. The purpose of our project is to develop a customer relationship management system for pharmaceutical companies. 
\newline
\newline
Our mission was to study, design and implement three core modules:   
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Directory module.   
        \item Calendar module.
        \item Product module.
    \end{itemize}

\noindent To conduct our project, we have chosen to use the development methodology 2TUP, an iterative and incremental software methodology that has proven it success in the field of IT projects.
\newline
\newline
During our project, the mission was initially to discover the business, identify functional requirements, study feasibility and provide detailed specifications. Then we started designing system's architecture using various UML diagrams, in particular use cases diagrams, sequence diagrams and class diagrams. Finally we started the implementation stage, then tested and deployed the application.
