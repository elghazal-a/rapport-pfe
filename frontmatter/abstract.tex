\begin{singlespace}
\initial {T}his submission is the result of our work at \emph{Sayoo}, conducted as part of our graduation project. The purpose of our project is to develop a container-based cloud architecture. 
\newline
\newline
In fact, this project aims to reach an architecture that will enable automated management of the company's service. Then, our mission is to study the latest Cloud technologies to get a better knowledge of further parts.
\noindent In order to have a clear view of this project, we've defined several concepts and aspects of the Cloud and its technologies.
\newline
\newline
Initially in this project, we had to identify the issue then define the functional and technical specifications. After, we've focused on the analysis and design parts. We've developped several intermediate architectures that finally lead us to the appropriate architecture.
